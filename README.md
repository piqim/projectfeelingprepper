# projectfeelingprepper
The web app (Codename: FeelingPrepper) is intended to help people with anxiety, depression, and BPD organize their thoughts and feelings through various methods, such as DBT TIPP, GRAPES, and Cognitive Triangle (STFB).

The webapp will consist of a frontend framework and a backend framework, namely the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The web app would have a user login system to help keep track of usersâ€™ records. The users would have records of their TIPP (history, added activities for T, I, P, and P), GRAPES (Calendar history, and their activities history on the days), and Cognitive Triangle (History). This will be a form-submission-based web app.
